# Functional Programming

_Declarative Programming Paradigm_

## Composition math
```
(f Â° g)(x) = f(g(x))
           = f(2x)
           = 2x + 1
```  
            
* First-class functions is treated as a variable.
* Pure functions is a function that works just with its inputs and doesn't affect the parameters.
* Recursive functions is a function that calls itself during its execution.
* Anonymous function is a function definition that is not bound to an entity.
* Higher-order functions are functions that can either take other functions as arguments or return them as results.

What else? 
* Immutable variables
* Non-strict vs strict evaluation
* Statements
* Referential transparency
* Data structures in FP
* Pattern matching
